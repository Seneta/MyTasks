# JYGraphView

***** 

## 29.03.15 - Updated for Apple Watch!

<img src="https://github.com/johnyorke/JYGraphView/blob/master/JYGraphViewDemoProject/Screenshots/watch_preview.png?raw=true">

I've added a method to the class (`graphImage`) that can return a snapshot of the graph (as a UIImage) which can be used on the Apple Watch. You'll need to make some adjustments to the font size and stroke width but it's fun to experiment! Take a look at the sample app for examples.

Typical usage:

```obj-c
 JYGraphView *graph = [[JYGraphView alloc] initWithFrame:rect];
 graph.graphData = data;
 graph.strokeColor = [UIColor orangeColor];
 graph.hidePoints = YES;
 graph.hideLabels = YES;
 graph.barColor = [UIColor clearColor];
 [graph plotGraphData];
 [interfaceGroup setBackgroundImage:[graph graphImage]];
```

JYGraphView is an easy way to graph data in a simple, minimalist style and is highly customisable.

# Intro

JYGraphView is a slightly adapted version of the graph that appears in [Tempo/Weather](http://www.appstore.com/tempoweather). JYGraphView is a sublass of UIScrollView.

You can get one on screen easily using code:

```obj-c
JYGraphView *graphView = [[JYGraphView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];

// Set the data for the graph
graphView.graphData = @[@2,@4,@5,@7,@8,@10,@10,@10,@12,@10,@20,@21];

// Set the xAxis labels (optional)
graphView.graphXAxisLabels = @[@"Jan",@"Feb",@"Mar",@"Apr",@"May",@"Jun",@"Jul",@"Aug",@"Sep",@"Oct",@"Nov",@"Dec"];

[self.view addSubview:graphView];
```

Alternatively, if you use xibs you can drop a UIView into your xib > Identity Inspector > change the class name to JYGraphView.

If you don't set any of the colours, fonts, etc, the graph will be displayed in its default style (same as [Tempo/Weather](http://www.appstore.com/tempoweather)). 

The default content width of the `graphView` is twice the width of the frame. You can set your own width to either narrower or wider values simply by setting `graphWidth` before calling .

**NB** The graph gets drawn on UIView's `didMoveToSuperview`, but in case you need to manually refresh the graph (if new data comes in) you can call it using `plotGraphData` like so:

```obj-c
graphView.graphData = newDataArray;

[graphView plotGraphData];
```

# Files you'll need

Drag the following files into your project:

* JYGraphView.h
* JYGraphView.m
* JYGraphPoint.h
* JYGraphPoint.m

By default the graph uses a UIView subclass (JYGraphPoint) to draw each point.

# Customisation

**NB. I highly recommend you download the sample project and run it on a device or in the simulator to play around with the customisation options (it looks better on iPad).**

If you wish to customise the look of the graph a bit, you can set the strokeColor and fillColor with any UIColor before you present the graph.

```obj-c
graphView.pointFillColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.21 green:0.00f blue:0.40 alpha:1.0];
graphView.strokeColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.53 green:0.00 blue:0.98 alpha:1.0];
```

You can further customise the graphView by setting the following before calling `plotGraphData`:

`backgroundColor`, `barColor`, `labelFont`, `labelFontColor`, `labelBackgroundColor`, `strokeWidth`, `hidePoints`, `useCurvedLine` and `hideLabels`.

You can opt to hide the lines, points or labels setting their respective properties to **NO**.

You can opt for the curved line that uses the [Catmull-Rom spline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmullâ€“Rom_spline) by setting `useCurvedLine` to **YES**. Default is **NO**.

So a fully customised graph might look something like this:

```obj-c
// Customisation options
graphView.fillColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.94 green:0.32 blue:0.59 alpha:1.0];
graphView.strokeColor = [UIColor darkGrayColor];
graphView.useCurvedLine = YES;
graphView.graphWidth = 720;
graphView.backgroundColor = [UIColor grayColor];
graphView.barColor = [UIColor lightGrayColor];
graphView.labelFont = [UIFont fontWithName:@"AvenieNextCondensed-Regular" size:12];
graphView.labelFontColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
graphView.labelBackgroundColor = [UIColor grayColor];
```

# What the graph view actually does

The graph takes your numbers, works out the range, translates them into coordinates, then draws the elements:
* background bar (which is actually a label)
* the line joining the points
* the label above each point
* and finally, the points

# Possible use case

1. Use the motion chip on the iPhone to show step counter data for the last 7/10/30 days
2. Link it to your app sales and show the trend for the last 30 days/12 months
3. Use it in your weather app to show predicted temperature for the next 24 hours/7 days

# Known issues

1. No tests. I know. I'm a bad programmer.

# Thanks

First of all I would be thrilled if someone used this in their project and let me know about it. Secondly, I would be equally thrilled if someone gets in touch with ways in which to improve JYGraphView.
